Mypy Type Check Coverage Summary
================================

MyPy checks on our CI/CD that all types are correct and they are used correctly.

In this report, MyPy outputs which parts of Pineboo source code lack types.
Whenever a module appears in red, means that some types are not properly inferred.

Click on each module to see which lines miss proper types.
