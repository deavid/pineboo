parser for javascript-like sources for AbanQ QtScript files.
-------------------------------------------------------

DEPENDS:

- Requires python PLY to be installed.

With Debian, you can install it typing:
$ sudo apt-get install python-ply

RUNNING LOCALLY:

Start up the script "flscriptparser" from the ./test/ folder

INSTALL:

You should create a symbolic link of ./test/flscriptparser to a folder inside
something in your PATH. For example:

ln -s /path/to/project/flscriptparser/test/flscriptparser \
  /usr/local/bin/flscriptparser


USE:

flscriptparser [file1.qs] [file2.qs] [file3.qs] [..]

Run flscriptparser without arguments to parse all files named *.qs in the 
current folder. If there are arguments, these are treated as files to parse.

It generates, for each input file, one output named .parse-filename.qs.log
where filename.qs is the filename for the file that you are trying to parse.


KNOWN BUGS:

It doesn't handle (yet) several structures, like array definitions [a,b,c] or 
extensive use of dots and functions.

* Fixed * It hangs up unexpectedly when trying to parse some files with errors. 
(You can try to hit Ctrl-C)
* Fixed * There are several problems if you try to pass a file with path as an argument.
