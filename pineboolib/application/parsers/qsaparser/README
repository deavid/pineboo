Example of a Javascript-like parser. 
This parser is intended to enhnace good practices when coding; so it's only 
cares about structure. It's not intended to execute any data. 

It was developed to aid the developers when coding something for AbanQ/FacturaLUX.

NOTE: Don't try to execute the parser from this folder, it will get filled 
  with trash files. Instead, enter to the "test" folder and run it from there.
